This robot named Lookar is a robot which saves input and identifies it. It will identify your age and enter it correctly only if you enter the correct input. 

Note: The bot doesn't save any input to a database.

No one, not even Lookar can see your input.

Future plans: Make the bot save permanent input if users want it to make it permanent. Add more questions as data.
